    <h1>Project 1.2: Website Sitemap</h1>
    <p>For the sitemap, I decided on making one for the website of indie game studio <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/" target="_blank">Innersloth</a>. The main intention for this website is to make blog posts regarding updates in their game as information for players currently playing them, and to provide selling points for their games for any consumers interested in purchasing them.</p>
