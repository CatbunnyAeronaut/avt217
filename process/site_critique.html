	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>The website is very navigatable. The site covers Rick Steves's overviews, tours, and guides on several European countries. Each page contains several links with individual articles on each country's cities (since I chose Germany, there were links to individual pages on Bavaria, Munich, Frankfurt, etc.), as well as links to revelant tours and guidebooks of the country, making all the links relevant to the end-user.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>The webpage is layed out in several expandable tabs with each one covering a different topic on the country of choice, so the user can expand whichever tabs they want to get information from. While this does obscure information from the user at a glance, this approach also allows for a variable experience for the user, making it very usable for people seeking to gain specific informaiton about a European country or city of interest.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The website uses a sans-serif font, giving it a more friendly and approachable feel. This can also be said for the website's hierarchy, since it starts off with an eye-catching image of Neuschwanstein Castle before its main header of "Germany". Each of the site's expandable tabs also serve the purpose of headers for each aspect of the country the website describes. Lastly, the website's footer contains information like FAQ and contacts, for people that went through the whole site but still have questions.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>The website mainly uses a color scheme of navy blue, white, and yellow, the same color scheme as the guidebooks Steves has written. With that in mind, the color scheme of the website makes sense, but even in isolation, these three colors synergize well together and keep the website's look simple yet still interesting.</p>
