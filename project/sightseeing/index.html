            <h2>10 Great Places to Visit on Your Kyoto Trip</h2>
        </div>
    </header>

    <article>
        <p>Kyoto being a sizable prefecture means that of course, there's more activities to do than this list can do justice. However, these ten locales are perhaps the most quintessential places to visit in Kyoto.</p>

        <ol>
			<div class="sightSee">
				<div>
					<li>Yasaka Shrine</li>
					<p>While there are many shrines in the Kyoto area, one that stands out the most is <b>Yasaka Shrine</b>. Originally built in 876, nearly 1200 years ago, Yasaka Shrine has a long history and cultural presence in Kyoto, specifically the Gion area. The annual tradition of the Gion Matsuri (Gion Festival) is also celebrated by the members of the temple, throughout July. On both July 17th and July 24th, two important events to the Gion Matsuri are held - the Yamahoko Junko, where artistic parade floats are carried by the people down the streets of Kyoto, and Mikoshi-Togyo, where three portable shrines are carried from Yasaka Shrine to downtown Kyoto, letting the deities of the shrines be in sight of the civilians for a week. The Gion Matsuri as a whole was originally practiced as a way to ward off sickness and disease, but has expanded into an energetic celebration worth seeing.</p>

            </div>

			<div class="sightSee">
				<div>
					<li>Kinkaku-ji</li>
					<p>Another shrine in the Kyoto area worth mentioning is <b>Kinkaku-ji</b>, due to its standout appearance. Its top floors are coated in gold leaf, which gives it its name (which roughly translates in English to "Temple of the Golden Pavilion"). It overlooks a landscape with a forest and pond, and the temple's design has even inspired the design of other Kyoto temples, the Ginkaku-ji (Temple of the Silver Pavilion) and Shōkoku-ji (roughly translates to Temple That Assists the State).</p>

                <div>
                    <li>Kyoto Aquarium</li>
                    <p>Nature lovers would love seeing the sights of the <b>Kyoto Aquarium</b>. They house several exhibits showcasing animals local to the Kyoto river and sea area, but there are also broader exhibits housing animals like seals, penguins, dolphins, and jellyfish. Additionally, the Kyoto Aquarium was even allowed to submit a national holiday because of their protection of the Giant Salamander species; because of them, September 9th is Japanese "National Salamander Day"!</p>

			<div class="sightSee">
				<div>
					<li>Kyoto Museum of Crafts and Design</li>
					<p>Kyoto is known for being a hub of Japanese culture, and there's no better place to showcase it in the <b>Museum of Crafts and Design</b>. The museum is home to a permanent exhibit with 74 different types of crafts being shown, along with demonstration videos on how they're made. Apart from that, there are even special temporary exhibits and events where artisans can show their crafting prowess to museum visitors. These special exhibits may even take a craft from the past, and update it using technology from the modern world. This museum is the location to learn about cultural staples of the Kyoto area such as Noh theater, tea ceremonies, family crests, and more.</p>

			<div class="sightSee">
				<div>
					<li>Nishiki Market</li>
					<p>Japan is home to street markets all over the country, selling all kinds of food and housing restaurants for consumers to buy. <b>Nishiki Market</b> is no different, being a 400 meter long street filled with stores selling foods like vegetables, fish, dried goods, yuba (dried tofu skin), and traditional Japanese sweets. One of the standout stores in the street market is the Snoopy Tea House, the perfect tourist spot for fans of Peanuts that want to see a different cultural spin on their favorite beagle!</p>

			<div class="sightSee">
				<div>
					<li>Teramachi Shopping Arcade</li>
					<p>Directly branching off from Nishiki Market is <b>Teramachi</b>, which, similar to Nishiki Market, is its own shopping street, this one instead being focused on souvenirs instead of food. Several of the stores in Teramachi sell religious items like incense and prayer beads, due to its history as a religious district, but now also sells things like art, books, clothes, and other souvenirs.</p>

            </div>

			<div class="sightSee">
				<div>
					<li>ROHM Theatre</li>
					<p><b>ROHM Theatre</b> is Kyoto's hub when it comes to both traditional and modern performing arts. Complete with performances of music and Noh theater that happen on a consistent basis throughout the year, and multiple halls to let these performances' creativity echo, the theater facilitates these performances just by design. On top of that, there are even other floors in the ROHM Theatre, housing cafés, and the top floor has a music salon, an exhibit for viewing various recordings of performances, orchestras, and operas, both of which are perfect places to go to after watching a performance in the theater halls.</p>

				<div>
					<li>Maruyama Park</li>
					<p>The oldest park in Kyoto, <b>Maruyama Park's</b> age does a lot of favors in giving it lots of landmarks to attract tourists throughout the years. The central point of the park is a large cherry blossom tree, perfect to view in April during the blooming of the cherry blossom trees. The park's large area is composed of small gardens, and is even located near multiple restaurants and shrines, including Yasaka Shrine discussed earlier.</p>

					<li>Kyoto International Manga Museum</li>
					<p>An interesting sightseeing location for fans of Japanese media, the <b>Kyoto International Manga Museum</b>, the first manga museum of its kind in Japan, was originally built in 1929 as an elementary school but was then repurposed as a museum in 2006. Now housing all kinds of exhibits on manga, including a single wall with over 50,000 books, this is a perfect visit for manga and anime enthusiasts and otakus alike.</p>

				<div>
					<li>Philosopher's Path</li>
					<p>Also known as Tetsugaku-no-Michi, <b>Philosopher's Path</b> is a calm, scenic route near the Ginkaku-ji, Anraku-ji, and Honen-in Temples. Like other locales in Kyoto, it is recognized for its blooming cherry blossoms during the spring, but is also unique for its canal that runs along the path. This is a great place for a calm visit to take your mind off the hectic stress that travel can bring - everyone needs a little break!</p>
