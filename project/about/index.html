                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The city of Kyoto was the original capital of Japan, established in their historical Heian period in the year 794. Kyoto's name literally translates to "capital city", with its colloquial name of "the peaceful capital" originating from the name of the historical period (Heian translates to "peace"). Japanese emperors would subsequently rule over Kyoto until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which politically reformed Japan as a whole, unifying the emperors under a single power, and one of the results of the restoration was moving Japan's capital city from Kyoto to Edo (now Tokyo in the modern day) in the following year. The city would slowly but surely develop for the modern age afterwards, industrializing and taking inspiration from Western countries to maintain their power. The threat of World War II in the 1940s, however, threatened the destruction of Kyoto, but the city was spared from largescale war related destruction, allowing many cultural sites to still stay standing to this day.</p>

                <h3>Travel Options</h3>
                <p>The main option for travelling to Kyoto from an international location are to take a plane that leads to Osaka International Airport (Itami). Due to Osaka being geographically close to Kyoto, travellers can get to Kyoto from the airport via taxi or the airport's bus service. Travellers often arrive to Osaka International Airport via a flight from Tokyo Narita/Haneda International Airport, due to Narita offering a larger variety of flights to and from various places. Alternatively, travellers can also reach Kyoto via Japan's shinkansen (bullet train) system, going directly from Narita to Kyoto.</p>

                <h3>When To Visit?</h3>
                <p>The time to visit Kyoto mainly depends on what travellers want to do in the area, but many suggest visiting the city in the spring or autumn. From late March to early May, the cherry blossom trees bloom in the area, with viewings in several areas taking place in the middle of this spring period in April. In the autumn time, specifically late October to November, the flora blooms in vibrant oranges and reds, creating a beautiful atmosphere. While there are still opportunities for sightseeing in the summer and winter, it is less recommended due to Japan's harsher weather during these seasons. Summers are hot and humid due to rainy season, while winters end up being cold and snowy.</p>
