        <p>One day may seem like a short amount of time for a part of a trip, but one day can still be filled with many visits to amazing places and memories to make. Kyoto is no different - here's your One Day Guide.</p>

        <ul>
            <div class="oneDay">
                <div>
                    <li>9:00 am: Yasaka Shrine</li>
                    <p>Yasaka Shrine is an important landmark to Kyoto as a whole and makes sense as a starter for this one day trip.</p>

                    <li>9:45 am: Maruyama Park</li>
                    <p>Since this park is in short walking distance from Yasaka Shrine, it'll be easy to go from one place to the other, and take in the nature and foliage of the area.</p>

                    <li>10:15 am: Shoren-In Temple</li>
                    <p>Shoren-In is a bit of a less known Kyoto temple, but don't let that discourage you - it overlooks a serene garden and pond, plus you may be able to participate in a tea ceremony and have a drink of green tea and a sweet or two.</p>
                </div>
                <div><img src="../images/odg_shorenin.jpg"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="oneDay">
                <div>
                    <li>11:00 am: Higashiyama Station (travel to Downtown Kyoto)</li>
                    <p>Via Kyoto's Tozai subway line, you can travel from the Eastern Kyoto area to downtown, where there are many more sights to see.</p>

                    <li>11:30 am: Kyoto Aquarium</li>
                    <p>A medium length walk from the station is the Kyoto Aquarium, filled with aquatic animal exhibits to look and learn about.</p>

                    <li>1:00 pm: Lunch</li>
                    <p>To get to this recommended lunch spot, you will need to travel via bus, otherwise the walk from the aquarium will take nearly an hour. Tenyu is a high-end tempura restaurant, selling various foods masterfully fried in the trademark batter, including stand-out ones such as sea urchin. However, because of the prowess of the restaurant, a phone reservation will be needed to secure a spot in advance.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="oneDay">
                <div>
                    <li>2:15 pm: Nishiki Market</li>
                    <p>An expansive place to grab all sorts of foods.</p>

                    <li>3:00 pm: Teramachi Shopping Arcade</li>
                    <p>Since Nishiki and Teramachi are connected, you can easily go from one to the other. Make sure to grab a souvenir!</p>

                    <li>4:00 pm: Kyoto Manga Museum</li>
                    <p>Here you can learn about the extensive history of the manga artform, even read one of the books or take a rest at the museum's cafe.</p>

                    <li>5:30 pm: Kyoto Cinema</li>
                    <p>Kyoto Cinema is a great place to see a film by an independent rather than big Hollywood names.</p>

                <div>
                    <li>7:00 pm: Dinner</li>
                    <p>Near Tenyu is the tonkatsu (pork cutlet) restaurant Katsukura Sanjo. This restaurant cuts above the rest with their use of high quality meat and homemade sauce, along with the ability to mix in additional flavor into your sauce such as sesame or mustard seed. Note that because of the restaurant's location, whichever one you go to for lunch or dinner can be interchanged, or replaced with other options nearby.</p>

                    <li>8:20 pm: Pontocho Alley</li>
                    <p>The final stop of the itinerary, Pontocho Alley, awakes at night time. The street lights up on the road parallel to the Kamogawa River, with the business's lights glowing and a chance at seeing a geisha performer, in the clubs or on the street.</p>
